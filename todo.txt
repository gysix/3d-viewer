1. allow settings panel to control:

	4) lighting - slider. dark to bright
	5) additional objects
	6) default camera (stationary, rotating, etc)
2. connect to amazon S3 for storage of 3D models
6. check out the yeoman generator for threejs experiments
7. site visitor options: choose camera mode (rotation, speed, orbit etc)
10. different compIds (components) corresponding to different canvases. same instanceId (user)
11. control where the title is in the canvas (positioning). button group for aligning right/left
12. optional settings on/off checkbox with shading strength, shadow length, lighting strength
14. add option for no background. then background is just a plain
16. show different models (from etsy perhaps). more products that wix users might actually use
19. fix gruntfile not copying some scripts to dist and to the wrong directory (a bug within grunt. cannot fix without troublesome workarounds right now)
20. fix gruntfile not prefixing the minified JS and CSS files with UTF 8 encoding 
21. use ng-repeat to allow for multiple models (optional)
22. background color of canvas not compatible with input type text/clicking. find fix/work around
23. upon initialization of the widget, make a post request to save user IDs. consider making GET request first to check if identification already exists
24. upon model upload, make a put request to save model path
25. when model is uploaded, take a snapshot of the model so user can preview what model was uploaded
26. saving/updating users: GET request on the user's identification, if success (identification exists, save the identification). if error or does not exist, save/post the identification. this logic will go in the front end
27. in settings.js on front end, put/update the collection
